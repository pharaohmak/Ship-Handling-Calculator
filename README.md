## Features

- Offline functionality: The app is designed to work offline, allowing users to perform calculations even without internet connectivity.
- Comprehensive calculations: The app includes a wide range of calculations related to ship handling, such as draft, trim, stability, turning circle, stopping distance, and more.
- User-friendly interface: The app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting ship parameters, performing calculations, and viewing results. It may include intuitive UI elements, such as sliders, buttons, and forms, for easy interaction.
- Customizable settings: The app allows users to customize various settings, such as units of measurement, calculation formulas, and display preferences, to suit their specific needs.
- Accurate results: The app utilizes industry-standard formulas and algorithms to ensure accurate calculations for ship handling parameters. It may also provide graphical representations or visualizations of the results for better understanding.
- Data persistence: The app includes features for saving and loading calculation data, allowing users to resume their work or access previous calculations even after closing the app.

## Technologies Used

- React Native: The app is built using React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps.
- Expo: The app utilizes Expo, a set of tools and services for building, testing, and deploying React Native apps.
- Calculation libraries: The app may utilize existing libraries or algorithms for performing complex calculations related to ship handling, such as hydrostatics, dynamics, and stability.
- Data storage: If the app includes data persistence features, it may use local storage, AsyncStorage, or other data storage mechanisms provided by Expo or React Native to save and retrieve calculation data.
- UI/UX design: The app may include UI/UX design principles and tools, such as Material Design, Human Interface Guidelines, or custom design components, to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
